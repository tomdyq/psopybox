# PyPSO toolbox #

## Introduction ##

The PSO toolbox is a collection of Python (.py) files that can be used to implement the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO) to optimize your system.

### What's PSO ? ###

PSO algorithm was introduced by Russel Ebenhart (an Electrical Engineer) and James Kennedy(a Social Psychologist) in 1995 (both associated with IUPUI at that time). It belongs to the categories of Swarm Intelligence techniques and Evolutionary Algorithms for optimization. It was inspired by the social behavior of birds, which was studied by Craig Reynolds (a biologist) in late 80s and early 90s. He derived a formula for representation of the flocking behavior of birds. This was later used in computer simulations of virtual birds, known as Boids. Ebenhart and Kennedy recognized the suitability of this technique for optimization and came up with the Particle Swarm Optimizer.

The representation of the optimization problem is similarto the encoding methods used in GAs. Instead genes, the variables are called dimensions, that create a multi-dimensional hyperspace. "Particles" fly in this hyperspace and try to find the global minima/maxima, their movement being governed by a simple mathematical equation.

## How To Use ? ##

This is the new PyPSO toolbox release 0.1.  Since this is the first release, bugs can ben found or docs can be missing. Please feel free to report issues, bugs or suggestions at the **Issues** section.

PyPSO was developed to be a generic complete particle swarm optimization framework written in pure python.
